# Welcome to Courtyard of Truth

Dear friends and visitors,

It is with great joy that we welcome you to **Courtyard of Truth**, a place where faith meets community, and where God's love shines brightly in everything we do.

## Our Heart for Community

At Courtyard of Truth, we believe that faith is not meant to be lived in isolation. We are called to be a community that supports, encourages, and grows together in our relationship with Christ.

### What You Can Expect

When you visit us, you'll find:

- **Warm Fellowship**: A welcoming community that embraces everyone
- **Biblical Teaching**: Sound doctrine rooted in God's Word
- **Meaningful Worship**: Services that honor God and inspire the heart
- **Opportunities to Serve**: Ways to use your gifts to bless others

## Our Mission

> "And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one anotherâ€”and all the more as you see the Day approaching." - Hebrews 10:24-25

We are committed to:

1. **Spreading God's Love** - Sharing the gospel with our community and beyond
2. **Building Strong Relationships** - Creating lasting bonds within our church family
3. **Growing in Faith** - Helping each person discover their purpose in Christ
4. **Serving Others** - Making a positive impact in our local community

## Join Us This Sunday

We invite you to join us for worship this Sunday at 10:00 AM. Come as you are, and experience the love and acceptance that defines our church family.

Whether you're new to faith or have been walking with Christ for years, there's a place for you at Courtyard of Truth.

**God bless,**  
Pastor Johnson
